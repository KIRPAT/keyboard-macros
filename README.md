# Keyboard Macros
I wrote some **AutoHotkey** scripts to take advantage of my cheap keyboard. Usually for video games. Not to cheat, just to keybind. Still, you might wanna take a look at [wanna-get-banned.ahk](https://www.google.com) for the situations that might.. get you banned. 

**Why AutoHotkey?:** Because gamers usually pay lots of money to have programmable keys on their keyboards, while a lot of keyboards already have multimedia keys on them. Without an end-user UI, they don't know how to change their functions. Well, AutoHotkey scripting is easy enough to understand, even for non programmers. We can turn cheap keyboards into MMO Gaming keyboards! Cool, right?

# How to use it:
* Install [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) (You might have to restart your computer.)
* Either download my scripts or write your own, and double click on it. Nothing is going to open, ***don't panic***. Check your taskbar. It should appear on the hidden icons panel. The green "H" icon is your script. 
* **To create an AHK script:** right-click somewhere, New -> AutoHotkey script.
* **To edit:** open it with your text editor, don't double-click.
* If you make changes to a script while it is still running, right click on the working script (taskabar, "H" icon) and click on "Reload This Script".

**Note_1:** AutoHotkey works only on Windows. (***GG*** MacOS and Linux users.) 

**Note_2:** You might ask, why am I not using the program that came with my keyboard? Good question, because it's not fun. Also, AHK scripts are not keyboard specific. I can use the same script on multiple keyboards.

**Note_3:** Some games might detect your AHK script and refuse opening up. Sorry, no can do if that happens. If you are running your game on fullscreen, the scripts ***might*** wont work. Try windowed fullscreen, or windowed modes. 

**Note_4:** I actually made a whole [video](https://youtu.be/aZVNEJgHlrA) about it in my language, Turkish.
