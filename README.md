# Keyboard Macros
I wrote some **AutoHotkey** scripts to take advantage of my cheap keyboard. Usually for video games. Not to cheat, just to keybind. Still, you might wanna take a look at [wanna-get-banned.ahk](https://github.com/KIRPAT/keyboard-macros/blob/master/wanna-get-banned.ahk) for the situations that might.. get you banned. 

**Why AutoHotkey?:** Because gamers usually pay lots of money to have programmable keys on their keyboards, while a lot of keyboards already have multimedia keys on them. Without an end-user UI, they don't know how to change their functions. Well, AutoHotkey scripting is easy enough to understand, even for non programmers. We can turn cheap keyboards into MMO Gaming keyboards! Cool, right?

# How to use it:
* Install [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) (You might have to restart your computer.)
* Either download my scripts or write your own, and **double-click to run them**. After the double-click nothing is going to open, don't panic. Check your taskbar, it must have appeared on the *hidden icons* panel. The green "H" icon is your script. 
* **To create an AHK script:** Right-click on somewhere. New -> AutoHotkey script.
* **To edit:** open it with your text editor, don't double-click.
* If you make changes to a script while it is still running, right click on the working script (taskabar, "H" icon) and click on "Reload This Script".

**Note_1:** AutoHotkey works only on Windows. (*GG*, MacOS and Linux users.) 

**Note_2:** You might ask, why am I not using the program that came with my keyboard? Good question, AHK scripts are not keyboard specific. I can use the same script on multiple keyboards. (Also, those programs are not fun.)

**Note_3:** Some games might detect your AHK script and refuse opening up. Sorry, no can do if that happens. If you are running your game on fullscreen, your scripts ***might*** wont work. Try windowed fullscreen, or windowed modes. 

**Note_4:** To see the names of every possible key on your keyboard, check the [List of Keys](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/KeyList.htm) page of the documentation.

**Note_5:** I actually made a whole [video](https://youtu.be/aZVNEJgHlrA) about it in my language, Turkish.
